# DaaS

> A microservice that creates and manages Dota lobbies

**This is a work in progress!**

`DaaS`, as in `Dota as a service`, is a microservice that makes easy the creation and management of
[Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/play/) lobbies. It was developed at
[Midas Club](https://www.midasclub.com.br/) to abstract all the Dota related logic into a single,
isolated and reusable service. DaaS uses [node-dota2](https://github.com/Arcana/node-dota2) under
the hood to communicate with the Dota game coordinator.
